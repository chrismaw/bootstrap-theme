                <h4>Pointing People to the Cross</h4>
                <p>We believe true healing starts on the inside, at the heart, where we examine the core of who and what a person believes and then further compare those beliefs along side of God’s truth. Each client is encouraged to build a new foundation of beliefs based on God’s truth instead of the many lies of our spiritual enemy. We encourage an intimate relationship with Christ, accepting and experiencing by faith the new life that Jesus Christ has available for us through his love and sacrifice on the cross.</p>
                <p>CrossPointe uses scripture as the authority in helping clients with their struggles. We have highly educated, well trained counselors equipped to meet the client's needs in a safe, confidential, one-on-one setting in our offices in Raleigh, Nashville and Greenville, NC.</p>
